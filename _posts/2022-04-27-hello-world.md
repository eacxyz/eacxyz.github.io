This is my first post on this website, which has been a long time coming. I had been planning on putting writing out earlier, but I just never got to it, until now. So what is this website and what is the point of it?

## What this website is

This is my personal website. I think of it as my homebase on the internet. Hopefully, you can find everything else I do from this website. I have links to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eacxns), [GitHub](https://github.com/eacxyz), and Substack. I'll add more if there's other places to find me.

I just got back into programming, hence the GitHub. I didn't have too much experience before, so I'm basically starting from scratch again. I'm looking forward to that journey. Making this website was the first part of that.

I'm not exactly sure how or where to put all my writing. I plan on having all posts on this website, though. If you want to receive them by email, you can subscribe via Substack. I'll either just put a link to the blog post on my website or actually have it written out in the Substack post. If you use RSS, you can get that feed at the bottom of every post. Any other thoughts and writing will be on Twitter.

## Why I made this website

The main reason I made a personal website is to learn in public. This is primarily through my writing, both on Twitter and my blog posts. This is an idea or principle I've heard many people talk or write about on the internet, but I probably heard it first from [Blake Robbins](https://twitter.com/blakeir). He's done it very well and it's inspired me to follow. It's also a way for me to learn more about programming, technology, and the internet. You learn by doing.

Writing and learning in public has practically no downside and unlimited upside. You just have to be willing to put yourself and your thoughts and opinions out there. Then who knows which person might see it and what opportunities arise from that? It's okay to be dumb or wrong. Hopefully you learn and grow from it.

I also hope it forces me to write more to become a better writer and communicator. You have to put the reps in no matter what the craft is, whether you're an artist, athlete, engineer, designer, whatever. Lastly, it's just something fun and fulfilling for me to do.

## How this website works

I am using Jekyll for CMS, GitHub Pages for hosting, and Cloudflare for DNS stuff. You can look at my GitHub as well. I used Dan Romero's Jekyll theme and edited some of the HTML and CSS. For more detail, he has a [post](https://danromero.org/how-this-website-works.html) on how his website works, but I'm not using everything he is. There's also other options out there like Substack, Notion, Ghost, etc.

In terms of writing, I'm not sure what I'll be using consistently yet. I've always used Google Docs for school, but I prefer [Skiff](https://skiff.org/) now for privacy reasons. I also think it's a better product. I'm actually writing this post directly in VS Code in a Markdown document. I might play around with Notion as well or find a Markdown editor. I also might just keep using VS Code. There's a built-in preview feature for Markdown files, I can write offline, and the file is already where it needs to be. I just need to commit and push to git, and the post is up on my website. I'm also a big fan and user of Apple Notes, so might use that. Currently, my thoughts and notes are scattered across different apps, so if anyone has suggestions on the productivity, note-taking, and writing fronts, please let me know. I've been looking at [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), but I'm gonna need to have a real job before paying for that software. One last thought on this matter is to just do what Derek Sivers does: [write plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext).
