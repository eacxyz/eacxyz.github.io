The end of Elon's [interview](https://youtu.be/YRvf00NooN8) with Chris Anderson from TED, at the Tesla Texas Gigafactory.

> CA: "What drives you on a day-to-day basis to do what you do?"

> EM: "I really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we're on a path to understanding the nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand the nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope and scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out... I would say I've been motivated by curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know?"

When asked about if he is sad, he says sometimes, but he is relatively optimistic about the future, and then says:

> "There are certainly some big risks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse is a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below what's needed to sustain civilization at its current level... We need to take action on climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure the future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species... Essentially, it's important to take whatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks that affect the future of consciousness."

> CA: "There's a whole generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them?"

> EM: "Well, I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be."

## Is crypto important?

Hearing this made me think about what's important, and what I want to do with my life. I've falled down the crypto/web3 rabbit hole this past year or so, and it's probably the industry I want to work in when I graduate college. I'm always looking for work in this space. But is it as important as the issues and problems outlined above. Probably not. But at the same time, I think it's fun and interesting, and is something I can do as a job where I can enjoy my work and have a fulfilling life. I think one of the biggest things we've continually seen out of the crypto space is how it truly changes the nature of fundraising and capital formation and allocation. We saw people fundraise massive amounts in such short time during the 2017 ICO boom, and then we basically saw a new version of raising capital through NFT projects recently in 2021. I think this may be the fundamentally most important thing that crypto enables. It's bringing people and their capital together for a shared cause. I think this can and will be applied to the issues Elon has outlined. Crypto will be able to fund the research and work in solving humanity's most important risks.
